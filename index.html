			<h1>Stephen Docy<br/></h1>
			<h3>Software Developer<br/>
				Beaverton, OR</h3>
				
			<p>I truly have had a life-long passion for designing software to solve all kinds of challenging problems.<br/>
			   My professional background in Systems Programming has taught me how to approach complex, technical<br/>
			   problems and to deliver solutions which are clean, robust and maintainable.  In my free-time, I have<br/>
			   been exploring the capabilities of Unity and learning how to develop mobile apps on Android with Java<br/>
			   and XML.  Working with Unity and Android, I get to relax a little and let my creativity and inquisitive<br/>
			   nature take over and guide what I create.<br/><br/><br/></p>

			<p>Have comments or questions about one of my projects or my Systems Programming background,<br/>
			   or have something going on that could use a seasoned coder?<br/><br/>
			   Drop me a line at<br/></p>

					</li>
					<li>Designed a music player app which features user-definable, grid-based playlists which allow users to create highly
					    customized music playlists. The class project did not include a requirement to actually play music (we hadn't learned how to do that
						yet), but I really love how the app came out and have been continuing to work on it, getting it to actually play music from your phone.<br/>

					<li>Our next project was a tour guide app using Fragments, ViewPagers and TabLayouts to provide graceful access to multiple pages of information.
						I'm sure Portland has more than enough apps devoted to it, so I created an app for visiting Mordor.<br/>

					</li>
					<li>Implemented an app to download music cover art.  My music player, Grid Music, is coming along very well, but its very
						graphical nature requires a full set of music cover art in order to be fully appreciated.  So when I learned how to perform network
						operations, including retrieving and parsing JSON data, I immediately began designing an art downloader.  Incorporating many new,
						advanced Android development techniques I had just learned, the prototype turned out quite well and is ready to be integrated into
						Grid Music.<br/>
