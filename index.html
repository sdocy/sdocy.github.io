		<h1>Stephen Docy<br/></h1>
		<h3>Software Developer<br/>
		    Beaverton, OR</h3>
			
		<p>I truly have had a life-long passion for designing software to solve all kinds of challenging problems.<br/>
		   My professional background in Systems Programming has taught me how to approach complex, technical<br/>
		   problems and to deliver solutions which are clean, robust and maintainable.  In my free-time, I have<br/>
		   been exploring the capabilities of Unity and learning how to develop mobile apps on Android with Java<br/>
		   and XML.  Working with Unity and Android, I get to relax a little and let my creativity and inquisitive<br/>
		   nature take over and guide what I create.<br/><br/><br/></p>

		<p>Have comments or questions about one of my projects or my Systems Programming background,<br/>
		   or have something going on that could use a seasoned coder?<br/><br/>
		   Drop me a line at<br/></p>
